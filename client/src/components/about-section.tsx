        <p>Hello! I'm Mania, a 17-year-old who's passionate about life and everything it has to offer.</p>
        
        <p>My greatest passion is <b>horse riding</b> - there's nothing quite like the freedom and connection you feel when you're riding. It's been a huge part of my life and has taught me so much about responsibility, patience, and building trust.</p>
        
        <p>When I'm not at the stables, you'll probably find me enjoying good food! I absolutely love <b>pasta</b>, <b>kebab</b>, <b>pizza</b>, and really any delicious meal. Food brings people together, and I love exploring different cuisines and flavors.</p>
        
        <p>Music is another big part of my world - it's the soundtrack to my life and helps me express myself in ways words sometimes can't.</p>
        
        <p>Life is an adventure, and I'm excited to see where it takes me next!</p>
